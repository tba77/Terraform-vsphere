# Terraform Vmware Vsphere
These are some terraform files for deploying Virutal machines on vmware.
Everything can be put on a single file but I prefer split providers form each server, for each server I create 3 files, variable files, main file and varibales assigned with values

Some optimizations and changes have to be made there are some variable written on the main file which is not recommanded. I'll update as I learn more
